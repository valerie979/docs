## Guidelines
### Write objectives
<img width="400" src="logo/objective2.png" />
An Objective includes two parts:

**Objective name** - a summary of what you'd like Duckie to do
<br />**Objective description** - details of your objective

A good objective would include two key elements:
1. where to change - include file paths, function names.
2. what to change - give clear instructions on what your goal is and what to change

If you want to interact with Duckie, please turn on Collab Mode.

### Add files
<img width="400" src="logo/files2.png" />
Duckie will then search for relevant files based on your objective. If Duckie missed any relevant files, please add the file path here.

### Interact with Duckie
If you turn on Collab Mode, you can interact with Duckie throughout the dev flow: 

**Objective Clarification**  
<img width="400" src="logo/objective_2.png" />
Duckie will ask you questions to clarify the objective. If you think the objective is clear enough, you can skip and continue to planning.

**Planning**  
<img width="400" src="logo/plan2.png" />
After getting a clear idea on the objective, Duckie will propose plans. You can provide feedback on the plan, and Duckie will revise it accordingly.  

**Task Execution**  
<img width="400" src="logo/task2.png" /> 
After setting a plan, Duckie will start executing the tasks. You can chat with Duckie to make any modifications to the task.  

**Code Review** (Beta)

After tasks are finished, Duckie will publish a Pull Request for you. You can directly comment on the PR, and Duckie will publish new commits to address them.  


## Limitations
Right now, we recommend use Duckie for coding tasks that require:
<br />  < 200 lines of changes
<br />  < 5 files to be modified
<br />  each file to be modified should have < 16k characters

If you want Duckie to work on a more complex tasks, we recommend break them down to sub-tasks and create a Duckie agent for each one.
